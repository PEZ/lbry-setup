# lbry-setup
An installer to set up [lbry](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry) and [lbrycrd](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd) for Linux.

If you're a Linux user who never uses anything that is more than one step to install, this is for you. However, it is written by an idiot. We can only officially recommend that you follow the individual steps above until non-idiots have corrected it.
